### 🛡️ Security Research | Always Keep Learning

Hi, I’m Samir Anastasio — a Cybersecurity Engineer who enjoys breaking things (safely), then figuring out how to improve the project.  

- 🔍 I like: digging into how systems actually fail, from Web Applications to Cloud misconfigurations.  
- 🧠 I learn: by building labs, running experiments, and turning mistakes into checklists.  
- 🛠️ I build: small security tools, scripts, and proof‑of‑concepts to automate the boring parts.

### 🧪 Current Experiments

- 🐛 Finding creative ways to trigger and validate vulnerabilities in realistic environments.  
- ☁️ Hardening cloud setups and seeing how far misconfigurations can be pushed.  
- 🤖 Using AI to speed up recon, triage logs, and explore exploit ideas (without skipping human review).

### 📚 Always Learning

Right now I’m leveling up in:

- Mobile & Android security  
- Cloud security and identity  
- Offensive security techniques and red team tradecraft  
- Secure architecture and threat modeling  

If there’s something new to learn, I probably have a tab open for it.
